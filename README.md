Taskwarrior-deluxe is a wrapper for the [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) task manager.

Taskwarrior-deluxe aims at being a proof of concept of how the task display may be better than the current one.

It essentially features:
- a fancier output, allowing better (i.e. more readable and/or good looking) ways to display tasks than the original table;
- the possibility to work with task repositories attached to directories, in the same spirit than a version control system.

Taskwarrior-deluxe is in early aplha stage and not ready for production.
